# No Time To Die

In this project I recreated the ending logo animation from the trailer of the upcoming James Bond movie "No Time To Die." I've been a big Bond fan from a very young age, and when I noticed that amazing animation at the end of the trailer, I just couldn't help myself and started figuring out how to recreate it myself for the sake of both having fun and learning. I measured the dimensions of the glyphs from the screen with a ruler, and the link to the exact font I used is at the end. Regarding to the animation timing and coordination, I just tried to replicate as closely as possible to the original by watching the animation over and over again at one fourth of the initial framerate - where there's a will, there's a way! I used a linear timing function, so it's not quite as smooth as the original. Ideally, I would have built it from the start with a custom timing functionality setting, because by the end it felt already too painful to refactor the code in such a manner.
