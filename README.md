# No Time To Die

In this project I recreated new upcoming James Bond movie "No Time To Die" trailer ending movie logo animation. I've been a big Bond movies fan from the very young age and when I noticed in the end of the trailer that amazing animation, I just couldn't help myself and started figuring out, how could I recreate it myself for the sake of fun experience and learning. Dimensions of the glyphs I measured from the screen with a ruler, link to the exact font is in the end. About the animation timing and coordination I just tried to replicate as similar as possible to the original just looking over and over again the animation from a trailer from Youtube with one fourth of the initial framerate (When there's a will, there's a way). I used linear timing function, so it's not so smooth as the original. I should had have built from the start with the custom timing functionality setting, because in the end it felt already too painful to refactor the code in such a manner. Sometimes during the animation something goes haywire and animation runs into dead end, refreshing the page and starting the animation again fixes usually that. Doesn't seem to be obvious problem with the code, if somebody has an answer to that, feel free to create an issue or DM me through social media accounts. Animation start button author creation Youtube video reference is in the end as well.
